# Scene-Text-Recognition-of-Signboards-using-Tesseract

1. Objective

The main objective of this project is to convert images to textual data. The
benefits of such a system are immense, it can be used in translation software to
translate the signboards to the native language. It can help visually impaired
individuals when this system is combined with speech synthesis and can also be used
in autonomous vehicles to recognize the traffic signboards.

2. Scope

In this work, the open-source text recognition(OCR) engine Tesseract is applied
to convert signboard images to textual data. Tesseract generally solves problems in
converting structured images to textual data but this does not work for a natural scene
that has different attributes than structured data. Various approaches to implement
Tesseract on unstructured images will be applied and the results obtained are
compared with the output obtained by using just the Tesseract engine.
